# Intro

This is a bare minimum iiif simple search server.

It's designed as a simple demo service that could be run in code space

The service will search all annotations placed in the data folder and return search result annotations.

At present there is no indexing, so this will not scale well. 

However, it should be sufficient to run in code a space and then link via demo manifest to get a sense of how the ecoystem works.
